                <ul>    Learning is a continuous process â€“ as we always say however I also believe that learning is a choice to make. In learning we opted to make time and sacrifice those rest time specially that I, personally have the work on weekdays and volunteering on weekends. Investing my time in this kind of trainingempowers me to become more of myself and to be more capable and equipped on teaching my learners especially in digital literacy. 
                </ul>

                <ul>    As an educator, I am open to more opportunities and this training program provided me with the experience I have been seeking. On our first day of training was quite educational since they went into great detail on the hardware and software of computers and how they function both inside and outside of them. It astounded me that, despite the fact that checking the simplest components in our own units facilitates troubleshooting, I had somehow forgotten to do so. The following Saturdays, we discussed spreadsheets, including how to utilized each component and apply it to our everyday tasks. Since we used to concentrate more on networking and troubleshooting than Microsoft application software during my senior year of high school, I found the material to be more interesting to study. Practical exercises aid in imparting knowledge, particularly in the areas of formula creation, chart creation, arithmetic and logical function computation, and powerpoint presentation creation.Our most recent topic, developing websites, challenges me because everything is fresh. I gained a lot of knowledge, particularly about how to build and operate it.It was enjoyable, and I learned things in addition to abilities that would undoubtedly improve my capacity as a teacher.
                </ul>
                
                <ul>    This extension project truly inspires me not just as an educator but also as a learner on the process to actively engage in developing my own capacity and not to limit myself on what can I do instead strive hard to do what beyond myself can. Being a trainee in this project shows that we can improve, and for that I am grateful. And even more grateful to this organization for providing us, Community ALS Implementers, with the means to strengthen our positions and get ready for what is coming
